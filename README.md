# Expository-Graphics-
We will look at ways to make your graphs more readable when you produce a report with them. 
Not necessary when doing data exploration, but when it is time to share the plots, need to make them understandable. 
We will look at:
•	labels
•	annotations
•	scales
•	themes
•	zooming
•	saving plots
